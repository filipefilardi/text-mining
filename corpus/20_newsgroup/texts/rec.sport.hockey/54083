Subject: Info - world hockey championships

Does anyone have any information about the world hockey championships and
specifically about the US team?  Game summaries and/or stats would be
greatly appreciated!!  USA Today reported that the US beat the Czech
Republic, but that was the limit of the story.

Thanks
Laura
