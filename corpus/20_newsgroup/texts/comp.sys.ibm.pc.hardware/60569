Subject: AMD i486 clones: Now legal in US?!?!?!

A friend of mine called me on the phone and told me he was wathcing CNN
and saw a report that the ruling prohibiting AMD from selling their i486
clones has been thrown out, making it legal for AMD to ship in the US.
Can anyone out there verify this?

Thanks in advance
Phil
