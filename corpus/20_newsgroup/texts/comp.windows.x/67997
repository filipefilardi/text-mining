ld: Unidentified external symbol
   _get_wmShellWidgetclass
   _get_applicationshellwidgetclass

  I use -lXaw -lXmu -lXext -lX11 -lXt not in this order but in a proper order

I am wondering if there has to be some changes in my link libraries or should
i include some more libraries.

ANy help in this matter will be very useful and highly appreciated

Thanks
