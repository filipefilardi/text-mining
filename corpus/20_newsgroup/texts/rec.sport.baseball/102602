hmm - i thought francesca's predictions ALWAYS hovered at or below
 .500, especially in the nfl.  (not counting college football
 bowl day).

he's a nice analyst for explaining past tense, and for mapping out
 what plays teams might do - but for predicting the future, he only
 looks good whne compared to russo.
