Subject: Wanted: Hypertext (or alike) for Win3.1

In fact, I'm looking for a possibility to connect different peaces of information
(like in the windows help system). 

And no, I don't want to program such a system by myself. The necessary effort and
afford should be as small as possible.

Thanx in advance,   Thomas!
