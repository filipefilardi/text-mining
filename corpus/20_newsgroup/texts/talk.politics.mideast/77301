Subject: Re: The Mufti again? meanwhile they support the genocide of Bosnians.

So why not condemn the Mufti for his Nazi leanings, and condemn all his
supporters, while also condemning the similarly genocidal killing of
innocents, Muslim or not, in Bosnoia-Herzegovina? Hatred and bigotry
remain just that, no matter who practices them.
