Subject: Domestic Content of US/Japan Joint Ventures


Does anyone know what the domestic content is of any of these:
Geo Prizm, Eagle Talon, Ford Probe

?

All are made in the US, but I have been told they contain mostly
foreign parts.  Please follow up directly to me, I'll post the
findings to the net if there is interest.

Thanks!
